In a previous post I explored how technology forces us to reconsider our humanity, and how the very qualities we prize as our distinctiveness leave us vulnerable as machines evolve. That post was provoked by my holiday reading list, which also included Midson's Cyborg Theology (), which perhaps unsurprisingly deals with this very thing. In it, Midson 

In Cyborg Theology, Midson provides a theological anthropological treatment of the cyborg, how it relates to judeo-christian bla and bla. In it, he outlines ways that the concept of the cyborg (literally, cybernetic organism), as well as our relationship with technology more generally, can be viewed within a theological framework.

Although a theological treatment of the relationship between humanity and technology may not be of interest to everyone, Midson makes the case that the stories that drive our present realities are very much rooted in theology. In this particular case, Midson explores how judeo christian tradition forms the basis...

The stories we tell are firmly rooted in... humanity is distinct in some way. 

Humanity is also fallen, corrupted. 


So what is the relationship between cyborg and god in judeo-christian? Midson spends the book exploring the concept, though in particular providing an alternative viewpoint to that provided by Donna Haraway, writer of the Cyborg Manifesto.. in it she writes.. cyborg ain't got no dust. 

Haraway's criticisms...

I gotta read these more I think

Midson's goal etc. 

In doing so he evaluates imago dei, our relationship with nature (and indeed, edenic fall), and also highlights how different 

_Some kind of foil here_

One approach might be to (co-creator with god = relational (hefner), clark we always use technology and think with through etc). Even this too anthropocentric.

Thus, Midson arrives at/ points to theological cyborgology. Relates to spiral dance.

Are we human are we dancer



In the 2008 song Human, Brandon Flowers of the Killers sings: 

>Are we human, or are we dancer?
>My sign is vital
>My hands are cold
>And I'm on my knees
>Looking for the answer
>Are we human
>Or are we dancer?

we question our humanity

In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine in 2008, Brandon Flowers of the band "The Killers" attributed the famous lyric "are we human, or are we dancer" to the gonzo journalist Hunter S Thompson,
