    "section": "",
    "text": "One of the key innovations that has contributed to the development of LLMs is the ability to convert words into embedded vectors, or vectors of word embeddings. Word embeddings offer a way of quantifying words while retaining some of their meaning. Prior to this development, computational text analysis was particularly challenging. This is because analysing textual information requires that we first quantify it in some way; convert some dimensions of the text’s characteristics, features, and hopefully meaning, into numerical information. Earlier approaches were as simple as counting word frequencies. From there, the unit of analysis changed, moving from individual words to combinations of 2 or more (n-grams). Generating word embeddings, the next step beyond this, involves specifying word tokens, and describing them in terms of their relationship with others."

    "text": "Internalisation\nLastly, internalisation is the process by which explicit knowledge is absorbed and embodied by individuals, reverting back into tacit knowledge. This often occurs through ‘learning-by-doing’, or when individuals reflect on and practice newly acquired knowledge. Internalisation cultivates an individual’s proficiency and capacity for innovation. The internalised tacit knowledge, once shared, contributes to the organisational knowledge pool. As individuals connect, recognise patterns, and synthesise fields, ideas, and concepts, a new cycle of the SECI model begins, fostering continuous knowledge creation and learning.\n\nKnowledge propels us forward, obsoleting itself as it transforms our understanding of the world around us. The SECI model provides a stable framework for orienting ourselves, encouraging continuous learning and innovation while accounting for change and disruption. Navigating the uncertainties of our world, the continuous conversion and circulation of knowledge - from tacit to explicit, individual to collective, and back again - empowers us to adapt, grow, and innovate. It also forces us to come to acknowledge the multifaceted process that is learning. The purpose of this post and those that follow is to serve as an example of this knowledge creation process, opening the floor for further contemplation, critique, and collaboration, aiming to cultivate learning, share understanding, and maybe even create something new."

    "title": "Cultivating Journalling Habits with AI",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Journalling has never been a consistent habit for me. Despite starting numerous times with a new notebook and the best of intentions, my efforts tended to quickly devolve into scribbled reminders and half-hearted notes. Over time, I’d inevitably abandon the effort, only to pick it up again months later. This cycle of inconsistent documentation often felt artificial—writing felt meaningful when there was something significant to note, less so when it merely served as a reminder of daily routines.\nLike so many others, I’ve recently fallen down the rabbit hole of Large Language Models (LLMs)—statistical models that combine contemporary machine learning with vast amounts of data to mimic and understand human language. The advent of LLMs however, presented an opportunity to create a slightly stickier solution. Rather than focusing on the specific outputs of these models, I found the concept of a conversational debrief with an AI to be a more interactive and engaging way to journal daily events.\nTo leverage this, I built a graphical user interface (GUI) that interfaced with a local LLM, enabling me to have daily debriefs in text or audio through a back-and-forth conversation. This project provided an excuse to work on my Python skills, while also introducing me to more complex concepts like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, the challenge of maintaining and updating a local AI assistant soon became apparent—especially as many features I sought were readily available through existing platforms.\nThis realization prompted a shift in my approach. Instead of engineering a specific way of interacting with the LLM, I needed to embrace flexibility in how I recorded and kept notes—be it a voice note or a quick text entry. I learned that the consistency of documentation wasn’t bound by the interface I used but by how regularly I could capture, record, and organize my thoughts using the tools at my disposal; a process which itself made the value of consistency harder to ignore.\nThis new strategy has proven quite fruitful. It allows me to write notes across various modalities and devices while focusing more on utilizing LLMs to search over and analyze this content. Previously it wasn’t clear who I was writing for or why. Now I find myself motivated by the mere fact that the data exists, and provides an opportunity for me to learn and analyse later. The journey taught me that sometimes, understanding what we truly need comes from trying the hard way first."

    "title": "The Shape of Ideas",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I’ve been fascinated for a while now by the prospect that knowledge, concepts, and ideas might be represented as geometric forms. Put simply, I’ve felt drawn to the question, “What is the shape of an idea?” This might sound like an ambitious question to answer—and it’s fair to say that I’m not quite there yet. Still, it’s fertile ground for exploration. After all, we’re living in an age characterized by the proliferation of analytical techniques suited for just this kind of inquiry.\nThese methods are, admittedly, quite specialized, rooted in fields like quantitative linguistics and computer science. But thanks to these very tools, we now have accessible resources—like chatbots, text analysis libraries, and visualization software—that help us learn, experiment, and build on our understanding. And what is it that we should be doing with these tools, if not not satisfying our curiosity by answering ambitious questions?\nWe may not yet be able to literally “see” an idea’s shape, but we can get closer to it by uncovering patterns and connections in language that hint at the structure of thought itself. Starting with a straightforward approach like Term Frequency (TF) analysis, we can identify the most frequently occurring words and concepts in a text. This might seem simple, but it lays a foundation, showing us the key ideas that will pave the way for further exploration. From there, we can take it a step further, examining co-occurrences and visualising the relationships between words, slowly beginning to sketch the contours of an idea’s “shape” in language.\n\nThe Text\nHere, I start with the text On Liberty by John Stuart Mill. A seminal work in political philosophy, On Liberty provides a framework for exploring the balance between state authority and individual freedoms. Mill argues for the importance of personal autonomy, emphasizing that individuals should be free to pursue their own paths, provided they do not harm others in the process. His work highlights the need for limits on societal and governmental control, advocating for the protection of individual rights as essential to a vibrant, progressive society.\nTo begin with, we need to load in the text.\n\n\n\nNext, we need to break this text down into individual words, a process known as tokenization. We’ll also remove common words that don’t add much meaning, like “and” or “are.” After tokenizing the text words, and removing stopwords, we calculate Term Frequency by counting the occurrence of each word. See below, where the word frequencies have been calculated and then sorted, to show the top 10 words and their frequencies.\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 Most Frequent Words\n\n\nWord\nFrequency\n\n\n\n\nopinion\n153\n\n\nsociety\n115\n\n\nhuman\n106\n\n\nopinions\n104\n\n\npeople\n97\n\n\ntruth\n96\n\n\npersons\n93\n\n\nliberty\n91\n\n\nconduct\n88\n\n\nindividual\n88\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlright, now we have a list of words and their frequencies. While these frequencies give us a sense of the text’s main content, they don’t really illustrate the relationships between concepts or the progression of ideas throughout the work. Some terms may need cleaning up (for instance, “opinion” vs. “opinions” or “persons” vs. “people”), but even that requires judgment about whether these variations carry different meanings or appear in distinct contexts. For now, we’ll work with the terms as they are and focus on visualizing the relationships between them.\n\n\nCo-occurrence analysis\nTo visualize the relationships between our top 10 most frequent words, we’ll examine how they occur together within the text. This approach—called a co-occurrence analysis—will help reveal patterns and associations between terms.\nFirst, we define a window of co-occurrence—in this case, 1—which essentially means we’re looking at pairs of consecutive words. Whenever two of these words appear side-by-side in the text, we count that as a co-occurrence (don’t forget, we’ve removed stopwords, so these words will co-occur more than you may think).\nNote that this window choice of 1 could be whatever we want it to be. However, by keeping the window small for now we limit our focus to direct, immediate relationships rather than looser connections that might dilute the strength of association.\nBelow, we can see that of our top 10 most frequently occurring words, the 2 that appear together the most are opinion and truth, followed by society and individual. Immediately, this makes intuitive sense, afterall On Liberty is an exploration of the relationship between society and individuals, and explores how this is in part due to the nature of/ how they interact with truth and opinion\nBelow, we can see that among our top 10 most frequently occurring words, the pair that appears together most often is opinion and truth, followed by society and individual. This immediately aligns with the themes of On Liberty, which we already know to be an exploration of the relationship between society and individuals, and how these interactions are shaped by concepts of truth and opinion.\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 Word Co-Occurrences\n\n\nWord 1\nWord 2\nFrequency\n\n\n\n\nopinion\ntruth\n29\n\n\nsociety\nindividual\n26\n\n\nopinions\nopinion\n23\n\n\ntruth\nopinion\n21\n\n\ntruth\nopinions\n20\n\n\nindividual\nsociety\n17\n\n\nopinions\ntruth\n17\n\n\nconduct\nsociety\n16\n\n\nhuman\npersons\n16\n\n\nindividual\nliberty\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo that’s quite satisfying, at least we know that a simple count of word frequencies and co-occurrences can get us some pretty representative information. This isn’t quite yet the shape of an idea though, we need a few more steps to visualise these relationships. The next step is to create a co-occurrence matrix.\n\n\nCo-occurrence network graph\nA co-occurrence matrix is a table that shows how often each word appears alongside every other word within a specified window of text. In this matrix, rows and columns represent words, and each cell contains the co-occurrence count for that word pair. For instance, if liberty and individual appear near each other 15 times, the matrix will show this count in the corresponding cell. This matrix provides a comprehensive view of all pairwise word relationships in the text, quantifying the connections between each word.\nOnce we have this co-occurrence matrix, we can take it a step further by translating it into a network graph. In the network graph, each word is represented as a node and the connections between them—based on their co-occurrence counts—are shown as edges. The weight of each edge (i.e., the thickness of the line connecting two words) reflects the frequency of co-occurrence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we have a visual representation of the relationships between the top 10 words in John Stuart Mill’s On Liberty. Technically speaking, this is a relatively simple achievement, but it’s been a valuable exercise in setting up foundational concepts we’ll revisit later. Word frequency alone is a fairly basic approach, but it serves as a stepping stone toward more sophisticated methods like TF-IDF. Eventually, we’ll be extracting topics statistically, representing words as embeddings and performing more complex analyses, but for now, this is a useful start.\n\n\n\n\nOn Liberty has become, partly by chance and partly by choice, my go-to text for exploring text analysis projects. Even with these basic techniques, the key themes of the text are already beginning to emerge. The tension between society and the individual appears, in part, as a struggle over truth and opinion. While this may not be exactly what I meant by identifying the “shape of an idea,” it’s quite fitting and tells us something valuable about the shape of ideas—that they’re molded by the individuals who hold them and the world they inhabit."
