    "section": "",
    "text": "One of the key innovations that has contributed to the development of LLMs is the ability to convert words into embedded vectors, or vectors of word embeddings. Word embeddings offer a way of quantifying words while retaining some of their meaning. Prior to this development, computational text analysis was particularly challenging. This is because analysing textual information requires that we first quantify it in some way; convert some dimensions of the text’s characteristics, features, and hopefully meaning, into numerical information. Earlier approaches were as simple as counting word frequencies. From there, the unit of analysis changed, moving from individual words to combinations of 2 or more (n-grams). Generating word embeddings, the next step beyond this, involves specifying word tokens, and describing them in terms of their relationship with others."

It makes itself constantly obsolete, so that today’s advanced knowledge is tomorrow’s ignorance.

    "text": "Internalisation\nLastly, internalisation is the process by which explicit knowledge is absorbed and embodied by individuals, reverting back into tacit knowledge. This often occurs through ‘learning-by-doing’, or when individuals reflect on and practice newly acquired knowledge. Internalisation cultivates an individual’s proficiency and capacity for innovation. The internalised tacit knowledge, once shared, contributes to the organisational knowledge pool. As individuals connect, recognise patterns, and synthesise fields, ideas, and concepts, a new cycle of the SECI model begins, fostering continuous knowledge creation and learning.\n\nKnowledge propels us forward, obsoleting itself as it transforms our understanding of the world around us. The SECI model provides a stable framework for orienting ourselves, encouraging continuous learning and innovation while accounting for change and disruption. Navigating the uncertainties of our world, the continuous conversion and circulation of knowledge - from tacit to explicit, individual to collective, and back again - empowers us to adapt, grow, and innovate. It also forces us to come to acknowledge the multifaceted process that is learning. The purpose of this post and those that follow is to serve as an example of this knowledge creation process, opening the floor for further contemplation, critique, and collaboration, aiming to cultivate learning, share understanding, and maybe even create something new."

    "title": "Cultivating Journalling Habits with AI",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Journalling has never been a consistent habit for me. Despite starting numerous times with a new notebook and the best of intentions, my efforts tended to quickly devolve into scribbled reminders and half-hearted notes. Over time, I’d inevitably abandon the effort, only to pick it up again months later. This cycle of inconsistent documentation often felt artificial—writing felt meaningful when there was something significant to note, less so when it merely served as a reminder of daily routines.\nLike so many others, I’ve recently fallen down the rabbit hole of Large Language Models (LLMs)—statistical models that combine contemporary machine learning with vast amounts of data to mimic and understand human language. The advent of LLMs however, presented an opportunity to create a slightly stickier solution. Rather than focusing on the specific outputs of these models, I found the concept of a conversational debrief with an AI to be a more interactive and engaging way to journal daily events.\nTo leverage this, I built a graphical user interface (GUI) that interfaced with a local LLM, enabling me to have daily debriefs in text or audio through a back-and-forth conversation. This project provided an excuse to work on my Python skills, while also introducing me to more complex concepts like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, the challenge of maintaining and updating a local AI assistant soon became apparent—especially as many features I sought were readily available through existing platforms.\nThis realization prompted a shift in my approach. Instead of engineering a specific way of interacting with the LLM, I needed to embrace flexibility in how I recorded and kept notes—be it a voice note or a quick text entry. I learned that the consistency of documentation wasn’t bound by the interface I used but by how regularly I could capture, record, and organize my thoughts using the tools at my disposal; a process which itself made the value of consistency harder to ignore.\nThis new strategy has proven quite fruitful. It allows me to write notes across various modalities and devices while focusing more on utilizing LLMs to search over and analyze this content. Previously it wasn’t clear who I was writing for or why. Now I find myself motivated by the mere fact that the data exists, and provides an opportunity for me to learn and analyse later. The journey taught me that sometimes, understanding what we truly need comes from trying the hard way first."

    "text": "I’ve been fascinated for a while now by the prospect that knowledge, concepts, and ideas might be represented as geometric forms. Put simply, I’ve felt drawn to the question, “What is the shape of an idea?” This might sound like an ambitious question to answer—and it’s fair to say that I’m not quite there yet. Still, it’s fertile ground for exploration. After all, we’re living in an age characterized by the proliferation of analytical techniques suited for just this kind of inquiry.\nThese methods are, admittedly, quite specialized, rooted in fields like quantitative linguistics and computer science. But thanks to these very tools, we now have accessible resources—like chatbots, text analysis libraries, and visualization software—that help us learn, experiment, and build on our understanding. And what is it that we should be doing with these tools, if not not satisfying our curiosity by answering ambitious questions?\nWe may not yet be able to literally “see” an idea’s shape, but we can get closer to it by uncovering patterns and connections in language that hint at the structure of thought itself. Starting with a straightforward approach like Term Frequency (TF) analysis, we can identify the most frequently occurring words and concepts in a text. This might seem simple, but it lays a foundation, showing us the key ideas that will pave the way for further exploration. From there, we can take it a step further, examining co-occurrences and visualising the relationships between words, slowly beginning to sketch the contours of an idea’s “shape” in language.\n\nThe Text\nHere, I start with the text On Liberty by John Stuart Mill. A seminal work in political philosophy, On Liberty provides a framework for exploring the balance between state authority and individual freedoms. Mill argues for the importance of personal autonomy, emphasizing that individuals should be free to pursue their own paths, provided they do not harm others in the process. His work highlights the need for limits on societal and governmental control, advocating for the protection of individual rights as essential to a vibrant, progressive society.\nTo begin with, we need to load in the text.\n\n\n\nNext, we need to break this text down into individual words, a process known as tokenization. We’ll also remove common words that don’t add much meaning, like “and” or “are.” After tokenizing the text words, and removing stopwords, we calculate Term Frequency by counting the occurrence of each word. See below, where the word frequencies have been calculated and then sorted, to show the top 10 words and their frequencies.\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 Most Frequent Words\n\n\nWord\nFrequency\n\n\n\n\nopinion\n153\n\n\nsociety\n115\n\n\nhuman\n106\n\n\nopinions\n104\n\n\npeople\n97\n\n\ntruth\n96\n\n\npersons\n93\n\n\nliberty\n91\n\n\nconduct\n88\n\n\nindividual\n88\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlright, now we have a list of words and their frequencies. While these frequencies give us a sense of the text’s main content, they don’t really illustrate the relationships between concepts or the progression of ideas throughout the work. Some terms may need cleaning up (for instance, “opinion” vs. “opinions” or “persons” vs. “people”), but even that requires judgment about whether these variations carry different meanings or appear in distinct contexts. For now, we’ll work with the terms as they are and focus on visualizing the relationships between them.\n\n\nCo-occurrence analysis\nTo visualize the relationships between our top 10 most frequent words, we’ll examine how they occur together within the text. This approach—called a co-occurrence analysis—will help reveal patterns and associations between terms.\nFirst, we define a window of co-occurrence—in this case, 1—which essentially means we’re looking at pairs of consecutive words. Whenever two of these words appear side-by-side in the text, we count that as a co-occurrence (don’t forget, we’ve removed stopwords, so these words will co-occur more than you may think).\nNote that this window choice of 1 could be whatever we want it to be. However, by keeping the window small for now we limit our focus to direct, immediate relationships rather than looser connections that might dilute the strength of association.\nBelow, we can see that of our top 10 most frequently occurring words, the 2 that appear together the most are opinion and truth, followed by society and individual. Immediately, this makes intuitive sense, afterall On Liberty is an exploration of the relationship between society and individuals, and explores how this is in part due to the nature of/ how they interact with truth and opinion\nBelow, we can see that among our top 10 most frequently occurring words, the pair that appears together most often is opinion and truth, followed by society and individual. This immediately aligns with the themes of On Liberty, which we already know to be an exploration of the relationship between society and individuals, and how these interactions are shaped by concepts of truth and opinion.\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 Word Co-Occurrences\n\n\nWord 1\nWord 2\nFrequency\n\n\n\n\nopinion\ntruth\n29\n\n\nsociety\nindividual\n26\n\n\nopinions\nopinion\n23\n\n\ntruth\nopinion\n21\n\n\ntruth\nopinions\n20\n\n\nindividual\nsociety\n17\n\n\nopinions\ntruth\n17\n\n\nconduct\nsociety\n16\n\n\nhuman\npersons\n16\n\n\nindividual\nliberty\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo that’s quite satisfying, at least we know that a simple count of word frequencies and co-occurrences can get us some pretty representative information. This isn’t quite yet the shape of an idea though, we need a few more steps to visualise these relationships. The next step is to create a co-occurrence matrix.\n\n\nCo-occurrence network graph\nA co-occurrence matrix is a table that shows how often each word appears alongside every other word within a specified window of text. In this matrix, rows and columns represent words, and each cell contains the co-occurrence count for that word pair. For instance, if liberty and individual appear near each other 15 times, the matrix will show this count in the corresponding cell. This matrix provides a comprehensive view of all pairwise word relationships in the text, quantifying the connections between each word.\nOnce we have this co-occurrence matrix, we can take it a step further by translating it into a network graph. In the network graph, each word is represented as a node and the connections between them—based on their co-occurrence counts—are shown as edges. The weight of each edge (i.e., the thickness of the line connecting two words) reflects the frequency of co-occurrence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we have a visual representation of the relationships between the top 10 words in John Stuart Mill’s On Liberty. Technically speaking, this is a relatively simple achievement, but it’s been a valuable exercise in setting up foundational concepts we’ll revisit later. Word frequency alone is a fairly basic approach, but it serves as a stepping stone toward more sophisticated methods like TF-IDF. Eventually, we’ll be extracting topics statistically, representing words as embeddings and performing more complex analyses, but for now, this is a useful start.\n\n\n\n\nOn Liberty has become, partly by chance and partly by choice, my go-to text for exploring text analysis projects. Even with these basic techniques, the key themes of the text are already beginning to emerge. The tension between society and the individual appears, in part, as a struggle over truth and opinion. While this may not be exactly what I meant by identifying the “shape of an idea,” it’s quite fitting and tells us something valuable about the shape of ideas—that they’re molded by the individuals who hold them and the world they inhabit."

We also demonstrated how analyzing word co-occurrence provides additional layers of information, allowing us to discern relationships between terms and their significance in shaping the broader themes of the document.\nIn this post, we’ll expand on these approaches by focusing on more discrete chunks of text, such as individual chapters. This segmentation enables us to isolate the specific themes and concepts associated with particular sections, providing a clearer view of the detailed arguments that underpin the broader narrative. By examining these localized patterns, we can also better understand how overarching themes are constructed from more specific ideas.\nFinally, we’ll introduce a method for identifying the relative importance of words within the context of the entire document: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). This technique allows us to highlight the words that are particularly significant in a given section, shedding light on how distinct arguments and emphases contribute to the text as a whole. Using these methods, we’ll uncover new ways of exploring the structure and meaning of the work."

    "section": "What Does TF-IDF Measure?",
    "text": "What Does TF-IDF Measure?\n\nTerm Frequency (TF)\nTF is a straightforward measure of how often a word appears in a specific document, relative to the total number of words in that document. For example, if the word “liberty” appears 50 times in Chapter 1, and Chapter 1 contains 1,000 words, the term frequency for “liberty” in that chapter is 0.05 (5%).\n\n\nInverse Document Frequency (IDF)\nIDF measures how unique or rare a word is across the entire collection of documents (in this case, the chapters of On Liberty). Words that appear in many or all chapters (like “society” or “individual”) receive a low IDF score because they are not specific to any single chapter. Conversely, words that appear in only one or a few chapters receive a high IDF score, indicating that they are particularly characteristic of those sections.\n\n\nTF-IDF Score:\nThe final TF-IDF score is calculated by multiplying a word’s TF by its IDF. This score prioritizes words that are frequent in a specific document but relatively rare across the rest of the collection, helping us identify terms that best represent the unique focus of each chapter.\nWhy Is TF-IDF Useful? TF-IDF adds nuance to our analysis by addressing the shortcomings of simple frequency-based methods. While co-occurrence counts reveal relationships between common terms, they don’t differentiate between words that are central to a specific chapter and words that are common across the entire text. TF-IDF fills this gap, pinpointing the key terms that make each chapter distinct.\nFor example:\nIn Chapter 1, “tyranny” might have a high TF-IDF score because it appears frequently there but less so in subsequent chapters. This would suggest that the chapter has a particular focus on critiquing tyranny, even if “liberty” is more frequent across the entire text. In Chapter 3, terms like “individuality” or “custom” might stand out, reflecting its emphasis on personal autonomy and societal norms. By applying TF-IDF, we can uncover not just recurring themes but the specific terms and ideas that define each chapter, providing a sharper lens for understanding the structure and argument of On Liberty. This technique is particularly valuable for examining how Mill shifts his focus from general principles to more applied discussions, and for highlighting the unique vocabulary that drives his argument in each section.\nTF-IDF, therefore, is not just another measure of word frequency; it is a tool for weighting words by their contextual importance."

We also demonstrated how analyzing word co-occurrence provides additional layers of information, allowing us to discern relationships between terms and their significance in shaping the broader themes of the document.\nIn this post, we’ll expand on these approaches by focusing on more discrete chunks of text, such as individual chapters. This segmentation enables us to isolate the specific themes and concepts associated with particular sections, providing a clearer view of the detailed arguments that underpin the broader narrative. By examining these localized patterns, we can also better understand how overarching themes are constructed from more specific ideas.\nFinally, we’ll introduce a method for identifying the relative importance of words within the context of the entire document: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). This technique allows us to highlight the words that are particularly significant in a given section, shedding light on how distinct arguments and emphases contribute to the text as a whole.

    "title": "The Shape of Ideas",
    "section": "What Does TF-IDF Measure?",
    "text": "What Does TF-IDF Measure?\n\nTerm Frequency (TF)\nTF is a straightforward measure of how often a word appears in a specific document, relative to the total number of words in that document. For example, if the word “liberty” appears 50 times in Chapter 1, and Chapter 1 contains 1,000 words, the term frequency for “liberty” in that chapter is 0.05 (5%).\n\n\nInverse Document Frequency (IDF)\nIDF measures how unique or rare a word is across the entire collection of documents (in this case, the chapters of On Liberty). Words that appear in many or all chapters (like “society” or “individual”) receive a low IDF score because they are not specific to any single chapter. Conversely, words that appear in only one or a few chapters receive a high IDF score, indicating that they are particularly characteristic of those sections.\n\n\nTF-IDF Score:\nThe final TF-IDF score is calculated by multiplying a word’s TF by its IDF. This score prioritizes words that are frequent in a specific document but relatively rare across the rest of the collection, helping us identify terms that best represent the unique focus of each chapter.\nWhy Is TF-IDF Useful? TF-IDF adds nuance to our analysis by addressing the shortcomings of simple frequency-based methods. While co-occurrence counts reveal relationships between common terms, they don’t differentiate between words that are central to a specific chapter and words that are common across the entire text. TF-IDF fills this gap, pinpointing the key terms that make each chapter distinct.\nFor example:\nIn Chapter 1, “tyranny” might have a high TF-IDF score because it appears frequently there but less so in subsequent chapters. This would suggest that the chapter has a particular focus on critiquing tyranny, even if “liberty” is more frequent across the entire text. In Chapter 3, terms like “individuality” or “custom” might stand out, reflecting its emphasis on personal autonomy and societal norms. By applying TF-IDF, we can uncover not just recurring themes but the specific terms and ideas that define each chapter, providing a sharper lens for understanding the structure and argument of On Liberty. This technique is particularly valuable for examining how Mill shifts his focus from general principles to more applied discussions, and for highlighting the unique vocabulary that drives his argument in each section.\nTF-IDF, therefore, is not just another measure of word frequency; it is a tool for weighting words by their contextual importance."

    "text": "I’ve been using local LLMs for a while now, in a couple of different ways. Part of this usage is straightforward interaction: pushing their limits, seeing how far I can go, and also exploring aspects of natural language processing (NLP).\nIf I’m going to keep experimenting, I want to objectify and measure the text outputs I’m getting. That’s part of the motivation behind some of the work I’ve done previously, where I’m playing with different ways of extracting and quantifying meaning in text. That’s just one use-case though, falling more in the bucket of ‘traditional’ natural language processing. I didn’t need LLM’s to do most of that previously, though it’s certainly helped to learn about them. However, I have noticed that the remainder of my LLM based activities include production of structured output from unstructured data (read, constraining outputs to json), as well as transforming or reconfiguring text in some way (for example, summarising)."

So far, this is mostly text analysis–not as heavy on LLM usage as I initially thought. I’ve still relied on topic modeling with TF-IDF, n-gram counts, word frequency, and co-occurrence to see how words or ideas cluster together.\n\nHowever, one area I want to explore more is word co-occurrence combined with word embeddings. The idea is to generate a series of “coordinates” (e.g., sentence or paragraph embeddings) and compare similarities across time to map how ideas form and develop. That’s something I’ll be dabbling with soon."

I’m leaning toward a local PostgreSQL server, but that’s a topic for an entirely separate post."

I’m still experimenting with context windows and how prompts should incorporate page references, but even a basic summary of my notes is valuable. It lets me quickly revisit what I’ve read. And by embedding these summaries (or the text itself), I can later query them in a more dynamic way."

I still feel like I lack a standardized approach to analyzing and representing all this textual data. That’s the challenge: figuring out a consistent format, pipeline, or schema for local LLM usage that meshes well with more traditional text analysis (like LDA, TF-IDF, etc.).\nIn the near future, I plan to:\n\nRefine the pipeline for summarizing daily logs, so it’s fully automated.\nContinue testing different embeddings and ways of measuring text similarity or co-occurrence.\nImprove the annotation summary process, particularly how context is managed.\nDevelop a robust approach for integrating these structured logs and annotations into a database."

If state indicates recording, then recording is stopped and the state file changed. Saves recording as date-time (recording_%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S.wav)\n\n\n\ntranscriber.py\n\nChecks an index file transcription_index.txt against available files. Transcribes using whisper, saves as txt file in the same folder and adds names to the index. Whisper model size can be changed with speed/ quality tradeoffs. Currently specified as latest and largest - intended function is a scheduled overnight job so not worried about how long it will take. May take a while if a batch have been added in bulk.\n\n\n\nAudio Log Processor.py\nThe audio_log_processor.py script automates the process of transcribing audio files, generating embeddings from the transcriptions, and storing the results both locally and in a Supabase database. This is achieved through the following steps:\n1. Environment Setup:\nThe script initializes necessary configurations by loading environment variables for secure access to Supabase, avoiding any hardcoded credentials.\n2. Model Initialization:\nIt checks for a CUDA-enabled GPU to take advantage of hardware acceleration and loads the Whisper model, which is utilized for transcription tasks.\n3. Audio Transcription:\nThe script processes audio files found in a specified directory, transcribing them into text. It supports common audio formats such as .wav, .mp3, and .m4a. It tracks which files have already been transcribed using an index file (transcription_index.txt), ensuring that each file is only processed once.\n4. Text Embedding:\nFor each transcribed audio file, the script generates embeddings using LM Studio’s embedding model. These embeddings represent the transcriptions in a numerical form that captures the semantic content, useful for machine learning and data retrieval tasks.\n5. Local Storage:\nMetadata about each transcription, including the file name and the transcription text, is stored in a CSV file (audio_transcriptions.csv). This step facilitates easy access to transcription records in a tabular format.\n6. Database Integration:\nThe script inserts each transcription, along with its embedding and relevant metadata, into a Supabase database table called 'log-entries'. This enables efficient storage and retrieval of the audio data for various applications, such as content analysis and data mining.\n7. Index Maintenance:\nEach transcribed file is added to an index to prevent repetitive processing in future runs, promoting efficient resource utilization and streamlined operation.\n\n\nPDF_processor.py\nThe script processes a document specified by the user, converting it into a markdown format, extracting text content from this format, embedding the text using a language model, and then storing the processed data in a Supabase database. Here’s how it achieves this:\n1. Document Conversion:\nThe script begins by loading a document from a specified file path or URL. Using the DocumentConverter, it converts the document into a markdown format. This step is essential for standardizing the document’s formatting, making it easier to parse and analyze the text.\n2. Markdown Extraction:\nThe converted document’s content is exported to markdown and printed to the console for preview. The markdown content is then used to create a Document object.\n3. Node Parsing:\nA node parser, specifically a MarkdownNodeParser, is initialized to extract discrete text segments or “nodes” from the markdown content. These nodes represent chunks of text parsed from the document.\n4. Text Embedding:\nFor each text node, the script uses the LM Studio’s embedding model, nomic-embed-text-v1.5, to generate embeddings. Embeddings are numerical representations of the text that capture semantic meaning, useful in various machine learning applications like similarity searches.\n5. Data Storage:\nThe script prepares a list of these text nodes, including their embeddings and metadata, and saves this list to a JSON file named embedded_nodes.json.\nIt further inserts each node along with its embedding and other relevant metadata into a Supabase database. Each entry in the database corresponds to a node from the document, allowing for robust storage and retrieval capabilities for future applications or analyses."

And yet, almost in the same breath, he collapses this grandeur:\n\n“And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust?”\n\nThe very faculties that distinguish us — reason, action, apprehension — cannot overcome the futility he feels. It is an ambivalence that resonates with our present moment: the suspicion that the very qualities we exalt as our essence may also be the source of our fragility.\nWriting at the turn of the seventeenth century, Shakespeare stood at the cusp of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment. Renaissance humanism had elevated man as the paragon of animals, noble in reason, infinite in faculties, almost divine in his powers of apprehension. To Shakespeare’s audience, Hamlet’s hymn to humanity would have echoed this vision. And yet Shakespeare twists it: exalting man only to declare him dust. Hamlet’s despair is personal, but the gesture is broader — a reminder that if reason is our crown, it is also our burden, and perhaps never sufficient to secure our meaning."

    "section": "The cyborg as corruption",
    "text": "The cyborg as corruption\nA central theme in cultural and theological responses to technology is the idea that increasing reliance on, or merging with, technology represents a corruption of what it means to be human. The cyborg becomes a threat — not just to our humanity, but to our connection with nature, and, within theological narratives, to our divinity.\nThis latter point is key for Midson. Cyborg Theology offers a theological–anthropological treatment of the cyborg and its place within the Judeo-Christian tradition. The cyborg (literally, a “cybernetic organism”) here is not only a biological–technological hybrid but also a conceptual challenge: it forces us to reconsider how humans, technology, and the divine interrelate.\nAlthough a theological analysis may not sound immediately relevant to everyone, Midson makes a strong case that the stories driving our present realities are steeped in theological assumptions. Whether we think of Icarus flying too close to the sun, Prometheus stealing fire from the gods, or contemporary tales of technological hubris, these myths resurface whenever we narrate our anxieties about machines surpassing us. Even the everyday stories we tell each other about automation, AI, and biotech carry theological strands, whether we recognize them or not."

    "section": "Haraway’s provocation",
    "text": "Haraway’s provocation\nFor Midson, the trap lies in the Judeo-Christian framework itself. This tradition positions humanity in a triangular tension — bound to God, distinct from nature, and defined against technology. Within this view, the cyborg is always “other,” its integration with technology casting suspicion on both our creatureliness and our divine likeness.\nDonna Haraway’s Cyborg Manifesto2 crystallizes this challenge when she writes:\n\n“The cyborg would not recognize the Garden of Eden; it is not made of mud and cannot dream of returning to dust.”\n\nHaraway’s point is that the cyborg resists nostalgic longings for an original human essence. It cannot return to an Edenic origin story — because it never shared it. This provocation forces us to confront the ways our categories of nature, spirit, and humanity break down in technologically mediated societies. As she puts it elsewhere, cyborgs are “about transgressed boundaries, potent fusions, and dangerous possibilities.”\nYet for Midson, Haraway’s brilliance is also her limitation. By placing the cyborg outside both nature and divinity, she risks leaving us with no way forward. If the cyborg is fundamentally alien, then our present entanglement with technology can only ever be narrated as loss — a kind of existential cul-de-sac."

    "section": "Reinterpreting the cyborg",
    "text": "Reinterpreting the cyborg\nMidson’s central project, then, is to reinterpret the cyborg in a theologically relevant way — one that does not define it as anti-human or contrary to divinity. At the very least, he seeks to create space for theological engagement with the cyborg that avoids casting it purely as corruption.\nOne path is to place our relationship with technology at the heart of what it means to be human. This perspective echoes Philip Hefner’s claim that humanity’s divinity lies in its creative status as “co-creator”3, as well as Andy Clark’s vision of human–technology entanglement:\n\n“Our cyborg future, like our cyborg present and our cyborg past, will depend on a variety of tools, techniques, practices, and innovations… These will be technologies to live with, to work with, and to think through.”4\n\nFor Clark, the mingling of human and technological “fluids” is not an aberration but the very essence of what makes us distinct as a species.\nBut Midson argues that even these accounts remain trapped in anthropocentrism. They still define humanity substantively — by what we do, create, or extend — rather than taking seriously Haraway’s challenge to rethink the human altogether."

    "section": "Toward theological cyborgology",
    "text": "Toward theological cyborgology\nHere Midson takes up Haraway’s imagery of the “spiral dance,” a ritual she describes as both spiritual and political. For Haraway, the cyborg and the goddess are bound in an endless, boundary-crossing dance; for Midson, this becomes a way to imagine theological anthropology without defaulting to human-centred categories.\nAs he puts it:\n\n“Technologies are but some of the actors, (con)fusing with multiple others, as they dance the spiral dance. We may never be able to fully understand it, but we can become more aware of the moves that the dancers take and appreciate the profundness and intricacy of it all. Imago Dei, in a theological cyborgology, is likely to be about this choreography that brings together multiple actors.”\n\nThe move is subtle but profound. Rather than defining the cyborg as corruption or as a mere extension of human creativity, Midson reframes the human–divine–technological relationship as choreography — a complex interplay where no single actor holds the centre. In this, he extends Haraway’s boundary-blurring vision into a theological register, offering a way of thinking about cyborg identity that neither romanticizes Eden nor forecloses divinity."

    "text": "Human or Dancer?\nIn the 2008 song Human, Brandon Flowers of The Killers sings:\n\nAre we human, or are we dancer?\nMy sign is vital\nMy hands are cold\nAnd I’m on my knees\nLooking for the answer\nAre we human, or are we dancer?\n\nThe line provoked much confusion, though in an interview with Rolling Stone Flowers attributed its inspiration to a remark from Hunter S. Thompson: “We’re raising a generation of dancers, afraid to take one step out of line.”5\nIn Thompson’s context, the line reads as social critique — a lament for conformity and timidity. Yet Flowers’ lyric, and the ambiguity it leaves hanging, struck me as oddly resonant with Midson’s project. To be “human” or to be “dancer” is not framed as a choice between corruption and purity, but as an unsettling play between categories. Reading Midson on the spiral dance, I couldn’t help but think Flowers had pre-empted the metaphor.6"
